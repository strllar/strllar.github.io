## What is KLM?

KLM was brief introduced in it's closed [IPO](/klm/ipo) announcement.

## Risk Disclosure

* KLM is casual
  KLM is just a byproduct of STRLLAR Lab. We launched the network for experimental use and crowdfunded a bit money to cover the server cost. Distribution of the mass remaining KLM(>95%) is TBD. So we don't gurantee anything about the value of KLM.
* KLM is _currently_ centralized
  To have better control on developing activity, all *current* four validators we are running is fully controlled by ourselves. It's similar to the configuration of [Ripple](ripple.com) validators.
* KLM is in high inflation rate
  Yes, 7% annual inflation in first four years. It's cheaper and more significance to experience inflation in KLM network then in official network.
* KLM has no strong support
  We contribute part of efforts to KLM as individuals and has no extra financial support from neither investors nor SDF, except selling KLM.
