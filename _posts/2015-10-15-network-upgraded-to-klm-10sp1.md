KLM Network was upgraded to [klm-1.2](https://github.com/strllar/stellar-core/releases/tag/klm-1.2)(stellar-core [v0.2](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases/tag/v0.2) based)

Windows binary is available at [downloads](/downloads) page

## Endnote
Because KLM network was started before stellar v0.1, there is a breaking change of overlay protocol. So we upgradted all nodes to [klm-1.0sp1](https://github.com/strllar/stellar-core/releases/tag/klm-1.0sp1)(stellar-core [v0.1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/releases/tag/v0.1) based) as an intermediate stage.
